# baballe
Fun bouncing ball game in 3D developped in C langage using OpenGL and the GLUT library.

You control a ball on a track and try to stay on it. Controls are very simple : turn left, turn right, jump, accelerate, slow down, that's all.

My game is an adaptation of the Babal game that was initially developed in the 90s, for HP48 calculators.

You can go to the original project here : https://ufoot.org/babal/

The gameplay is excellent, the game takes very little CPU and GPU :)

What satisfaction to enjoy playing a game that I developed myself!

# Running

You need the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) in order to run the game.

GLUT is available here : http://user.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html

You have to download glut-3.7.6-bin.zip (117 KB) and follow instructions included in the zip file to install it. (it is very simple)

# Remarks

Programming in **C** with OpenGL and GLUT has been my most satisfying programming experience!

It's much easier than programming in modern object langages like Java or making the simplest Android app...

With GLUT, you don't have to spend hours (or days) trying to figure out complicated concepts to start developing something

With GLUT, in just a few lines of code, you can do very cool things!

# Compilation

Coming soon ...
